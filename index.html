            I'm Milos, and I'm studying Computing Science at Thompson Rivers University. I'm originally from Toronto, but my family has roots in Serbia. My primary focus right now is on building the skills necessary to become a software developer. I'm interested in the practical applications of computer science and how technology can solve real-world problems.

When I'm not studying, I spend a lot of time playing basketball. It's a good way to stay active and unwind. I enjoy the competitive aspect of the game and the mental focus it requires. It's a break from the academic side of things, and a way for me to stay balanced. Some of my favourite teams include:
            <ul>
                <li>Denver Nuggets</li>
                <li>Los Angelos Lakers</li>
                <li>Toronto Raptors</li>
                <li>Vancouver Grizzlies</li>
            </ul>
